% This is a MODIFIED version of the original method by Grosche and Muller :
% http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/MIR/tempogramtoolbox/
%
% Description:
% Computes a novelty curve (onset detection function) 
% for the input audio spectrogram. This implementation is a variant
% of the widely used spectral flux method with additional 
% bandwise processing and a logarithmic intensity compression.
% This particularly addresses music with weak onset information 
% (e.g., exhibiting string instruments.)
%
% Input:
%       V : spectrogram
%       fs : sampling rate of the audio (Hz)
%       parameter (optional): parameter struct with fields
%               .logCompression : enable/disable log compression
%               .compressionC : constant for log compression
%               .win_len : window length for STFT (in samples)
%               .stepsize : stepsize for the STFT
%               .resampleFeatureRate : feature rate of the resulting
%               novelty curve (resampled, independent of stepsize)
%
% Output:
%       noveltyCurve : the novelty curve
%       featureRate : feature rate of the novelty curve (Hz)
